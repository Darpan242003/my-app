text.split(" ") - Splits the string into an array using spaces as delimiters

Example: "hello world" becomes ["hello", "world"]
Example: "hello  world" becomes ["hello", "", "world"] (note the empty string from double space)


.filter(word => word.trim() !== "") - Filters out any empty or whitespace-only elements

word.trim() removes leading/trailing whitespace from each word
!== "" keeps only elements that aren't empty strings after trimming
This handles cases with multiple spaces, tabs, or other whitespace


.length - Returns the count of remaining elements in the filtered array


>> React Router
to install run: npm install react-router-dom
reference: https://v5.reactrouter.com/web/guides/quick-start

>> How to use React Router
1. import from the reference link above
    import {
        BrowserRouter as Router,
        Routes,
        Route,
    } from "react-router-dom";
2. insert "switch" in the div (component)
3. put your components inside "switch" (About and TextForm in our website)
4. put everything inside the "Router"
5. in Navbar replace "a" with "Link" and "href" with "to"

note: always use "exact path.." inside a Router,
it will render the exact page when clicked on it.


>>Deploy your website on Github:

1. visit this site: https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/#github-pages
2. add homepage to package.json at the top
3. replace the myusername and my-app with your username and your app name respectively in homepage.
4. install gh-pages: npm install --save gh-pages
5. add 
    "predeploy": "npm run build",
    "deploy": "gh-pages -d build",
    to "scripts" in package.json
6. Deploy the site by running "npm run deploy"

NOTE: after step 6 an error occured because gh-pages is looking for build folder but in vite a dist folder is generated.
for this change the line: "deploy": "gh-pages -d build", to "deploy": "gh-pages -d dist",

AND in vite.config.js:

ADD this line base: '/my-app/',

so the file becomes:
import {
  defineConfig
} from 'vite'
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react'

// https://vite.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
  base: '/my-app/',
})
