text.split(" ") - Splits the string into an array using spaces as delimiters

Example: "hello world" becomes ["hello", "world"]
Example: "hello  world" becomes ["hello", "", "world"] (note the empty string from double space)


.filter(word => word.trim() !== "") - Filters out any empty or whitespace-only elements

word.trim() removes leading/trailing whitespace from each word
!== "" keeps only elements that aren't empty strings after trimming
This handles cases with multiple spaces, tabs, or other whitespace


.length - Returns the count of remaining elements in the filtered array

        Routes,
        Route,
    } from "react-router-dom";
2. insert "switch" in the div (component)
3. put your components inside "switch" (About and TextForm in our website)
4. put everything inside the "Router"
5. in Navbar replace "a" with "Link" and "href" with "to"
